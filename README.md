# Personal Portfolio Website

## Welcome

Welcome to my tiny corner of the internet! Here, you can find out a little more about the mobile software projects I've been working on, my latest YouTube video, some articles I've written, and other things I'm currentl interested in and pursuing. 

If you need to contact me, there's a section at the very bottom of this README. Come say hi! 👋🏽

## Version History

**v0.4**: Add site responsiveness for smaller screens
**v0.3**: Finish templates for all remaining homepage sections
**v0.2**: Create initial project templates
**v0.1**: Update initial README file

## Branch Strategy

Branches for this repository will be in the following format:

```
sim/vX.X_addAContactSection
```

where `X.X` denotes different levels of changes. The first `X` refers to a major change which could be a brand new redesign of the website, an entirely new section or page, or any other significant update. The second `X` refers to minor updates of the project.

> **NOTE**: Until v1.0, all changes will be considered "minor" updates (the second `X`) as to not increment the first `X`.

The `sim` section of the branch name refers to an identifier for the person who worked on that branch.

PR titles will follow the branching naming convention so that previous PR's can be easily referenced:

```
[vX.X] Add a Contact Section
```
